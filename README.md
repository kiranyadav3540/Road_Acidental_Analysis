# Road_Acidental_Analysis
Developed an interactive Road Accident Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to analyze accident casualties across multiple dimensions.

The dashboard provides insights into accident severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight), vehicle types, road types, road surface conditions, weather, and light conditions. It also includes a year-wise and month-wise comparison (CY vs PY) to identify trends and seasonal patterns.

Implemented dynamic filters for accident date, weather conditions, and wind conditions to enable detailed drill-down analysis. The project helps in understanding high-risk scenarios and supports data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements.
